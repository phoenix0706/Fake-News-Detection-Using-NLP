# Fake-News-Detection-Using-NLP
This is fake news detection project using Python and Natural Language Processing
I downloaded the ISOT dataset from https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/ece/isot/datasets/index.php, and then loaded it and preprocessed it using various NLP algorithms like tokenization, stop words removal, lemmatization and stemming. I vectorized the text documents using count vectorizer and tf-idf vectorizer. After preprocessing, I split the data into testing and training and I built five models using five different classification algorithms and used the predictions to calculate the performance metrics.
SVM algorithm is the best algorithm on our ISOT dataset for the task of fake news detection and classification.
